# Sizzle

**A bitmap/pixel game engine based on Flame**

```{warn}
This package is in alpha and not yet production ready. Use at own risk!
```

This package takes all the hard work out of making a perfect pixel-art game. It's compatible with
other Flame features, so you can make use of audio, bloc, forge2d etc. The maintainers of this
package also regularly contribute to Flame itself.
